# Paint Style - WordPress Theme
-------------------------------

This is the theme for my personal Wordpress website, based off of the bare bones Skeleton theme by wycks (https://github.com/wycks/WP-Skeleton-Theme). I heavily customized it and added Wordpress Pods (http://pods.io/) to extend and enhance the Wordpress core. I made as much of the site AJAX as possible.

### Features:

* Minimalist design with a painterly look
* Fully responsive CSS layout
* Custom JS/CSS framework allows for seamless responsive box edge patterns
* Pages load via AJAX (contact and portfolio piece pages aside)
* Bundled with full 960 based CSS Responsive Grid
* Icon support for mobile and web
* IE HTML5shim support



### Default 4 layouts:
- Base 960 Grid       960px
- Tablet (Portrait)   768px
- Mobile (Portrait)   320px
- Mobile (Landscape)  480px
